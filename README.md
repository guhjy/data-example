One Paragraph of project description goes here

### Prerequisities
Our method is implemented in Python. The first step to using out method should be installing [CVXPY](http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/install/), whose dependencies are listed [here](http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/install/#install-from-source). In addition to CVXPY's dependencies, our method requires the following Python modules:

* ctypes
* os 
* math
* statsmodels
* pandas
* patsy
* matplotlib
* solving (our module; included in the repository)
* qualitativeinteractions (our module; included in the repository)
