# Data Example from "A Framework for Estimating and Testing Qualitative Interactions"

### Prerequisities
We implement our method in Python. The first step of using the method should be installing [CVXPY](http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/install/), whose dependencies are listed [here](http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/install/#install-from-source). In addition to CVXPY's dependencies, our method requires the following Python modules:

* ctypes
* os 
* math
* statsmodels
* pandas
* patsy
* matplotlib
* solving (our module; included in the repository)
* qualitativeinteractions (our module; included in the repository)

## Example
The python scipt "do_data_example.py" runs our method and produces Figure 3 and Figure 5 of the paper. The R script "do_logistic_regression.R" runs logistic regression and produces Figure 4.
